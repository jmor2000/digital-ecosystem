This project presents an universal digital/smart factory technology framework.
This projected is presented in the following publication:

# Purpuse
The purpose of this framework is to connect industrial controllers (manufacturing machines) and IIoT devices (process monitoring) to factory services (Manufacturing Execution Systems), and collect-analyze-display data (Manufacturing Intelligence). This initial purpose represents the foundational needs of an interconnected digital factory, and the initial descriptive analytics needs of smart factory.

This framework implements (1) field level industrial communication with OPC UA and MQTT; (2) Graphical Programming Inter-faces (GPI) for Cyber Physical System (CPS) integration and data visualization; and (3) virtual Containers to deploy software applications and services in a ubiquitous scalable “Fog-cluster”. For simplicity/clarity between Fog-nodes and Node-red, Fog-nodes will be from here on in referred to as Fog-clusters.
